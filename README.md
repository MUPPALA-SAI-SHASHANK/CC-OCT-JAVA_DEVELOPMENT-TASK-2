After Navigating to the Main page We can see the Option to Donate Money.
This Donation of Money page was Integrated with Razorpay and it is a Test Mode Payment GateWay Page. So, It doesnot Officially asks us to pay the money.![Mail6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108987073/198876307-6c6e9a88-072c-461b-9984-6a7870ed7875.jpg)
